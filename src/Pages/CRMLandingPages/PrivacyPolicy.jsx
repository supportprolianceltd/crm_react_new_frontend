            <h3>E3OS Privacy Commitment</h3>
            <p>
              At E3OS, we place the highest priority on the privacy and
              protection of our customers’ and users’ data. From the foundation
              of the E3OS platform, privacy has been treated as a core principle
              not as a compliance checkbox, but as a fundamental responsibility.
              Our approach is built on transparency, data minimization, and
              respect for user control.
            </p>
            <p>
              E3OS collects only the minimum amount of information necessary to
              deliver our services, operate the platform effectively, and fulfil
              specific transactions or regulatory obligations. All data
              collected is relevant, purposeful, and aligned with the legitimate
              needs of healthcare, staffing, and service organizations that rely
              on E3OS to manage critical operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are committed to openness about the information we collect and
              how it is used. Users and client organizations are providing
              visibility into their data and are given appropriate controls to
              manage preferences, limit certain engagements, and exercise their
              data rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              Importantly, E3OS does not generate revenue from advertising, data
              brokerage, or the sale of user information. We do not use customer
              or user data for advertising purposes, nor do we permit third
              parties to do so. This ensures there is no conflict of interest
              between delivering value through our platform and safeguarding
              privacy. Our business model is centered solely on providing
              secure, reliable, and compliant software solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to clearly outline what
              information E3OS collects, how it is used, how it is protected,
              and the circumstances under which it may be shared. While
              detailed, this policy is designed to address all relevant
              scenarios clearly and unambiguously. We strive to present this
              information in a straightforward and accessible manner to ensure
              full understanding and trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              E3OS remains committed to continuously strengthening our privacy
              practices and aligning with evolving data protection standards
              across all regions we operate in.

            <h3>Part II – Information E3OS Processes on Your Behalf</h3>
            <h4>Information Entrusted to E3OS and Purpose of Processing </h4>
            <p>
              When you or your organization use the E3OS platform or request
              support services, you may entrust E3OS with information that you
              control (“Service Data”). In this context, E3OS typically acts as
              a data processor, processing information strictly in accordance
              with your instructions and the applicable service agreements.
            </p>
            <h4>Information Provided in Connection with E3OS Services</h4>
            <p>
              {" "}
              You may provide or upload information to E3OS as part of using our
              services or requesting technical, administrative, or customer
              support. This may include data relating to your employees,
              contractors, clients, patients, service users, vendors, or other
              individuals, depending on the modules you use (such as
              recruitment, HR, rostering, payroll, finance, compliance, asset
              management, or care operations).
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you act as a data controller, E3OS processes such
              information on your behalf to deliver the platform’s
              functionality. Where you act as a data processor on behalf of
              another party, E3OS processes the data in line with your
              instructions and the agreed scope of services. Service Data may be
              stored on E3OS servers during platform usage or temporarily
              accessed, transferred, or shared with E3OS for the purpose of
              providing technical support, troubleshooting, implementation, or
              related services.
            </p>
            <h4>Information from Mobile Devices</h4>
            <p>
              Where location-based features are enabled, E3OS may collect
              location information for specific operational purposes, such as
              shift check-ins, workforce tracking, service delivery
              verification, or location-based reminders. Location data is used
              strictly within the context of the enabled feature and, where
              applicable, shared only with authorized mapping or location
              service providers to support functionality.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              You may control or disable mobile application permissions at any
              time through your device settings. Information accessed from your
              device may either be associated with your E3OS account and stored
              on our servers (where required to provide the service) or remain
              locally on your device unless you choose to upload or share it.
            </p>
            <h4>Ownership and Control of Your Service Data</h4>
            <p>
              E3OS recognises that you retain full ownership of all Service Data
              entrusted to the platform. E3OS does not claim ownership over your
              data and processes it solely in accordance with your instructions
              and applicable agreements. To ensure transparency and control,
              E3OS provides you with the ability to:{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Access and review your Service Data at any time through the
              relevant E3OS modules; Share or connect your Service Data with
              supported third-party integrations that you choose to enable; and
              Request the export, transfer, or deletion of your Service Data,
              subject to applicable legal, contractual, and regulatory
              requirements. These controls are designed to support data
              portability, operational flexibility, and compliance across your
              organization.{" "}

            <p>
              {" "}
              Authorised E3OS employees and approved independent contractors may
              access Service Data solely for legitimate operational purposes,
              such as identifying and resolving technical issues, verifying
              system outputs, supporting audits, or responding to support
              requests initiated by you. Access is restricted to designated
              individuals, logged, monitored, and subject to audit controls.
              Employees may also access Service Data that you deliberately share
              for troubleshooting, data migration, or support purposes. E3OS
              enforces strict internal privacy and security policies across all
              personnel.
            </p>
            <h4>Collaborators and Authorized Users</h4>
            <p>
              Some E3OS modules enable collaboration among users within or
              outside your organization. When collaboration is enabled,
              authorized collaborators may view or interact with certain Service
              Data in line with the permissions you assign. For example, when
              multiple users work on the same records, schedules, or documents,
              identifying information such as names or profile details may be
              visible to support accountability and auditability.{" "}
            </p>
            <h4>Third-Party Integrations You Enable</h4>
            <p>
              {" "}
              E3OS supports integrations with third-party applications and
              services to extend platform functionality. Where you choose to
              enable an integration, relevant Service Data may be shared with
              the third party to enable that integration. The use of your data
              by such third parties is governed by their own privacy policies,
              and E3OS encourages you to review those policies before enabling
              integrations.
            </p>
            <h4>Retention of Information</h4>
            <p>
              E3OS retains the data associated with your account for as long as
              you continue to use the E3OS platform and its services. This
              ensures uninterrupted access to features, records, and operational
              data across all enabled modules.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to terminate your E3OS user or organizational
              account, your data will be scheduled for removal from E3OS’s
              active databases in accordance with our standard system clean-up
              processes. Deletion from active systems typically occurs during
              periodic clean-up cycles, which are conducted at regular
              intervals.{" "}

              Data that has been removed from active databases may remain in
              secure backup systems for a limited period solely for disaster
              recovery and business continuity purposes. Such backup data is
              automatically and permanently deleted in line with our backup
              retention schedule, after which it is no longer accessible or
              recoverable.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              E3OS applies appropriate technical and organizational safeguards
              throughout the data retention and deletion process to ensure
              confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with applicable data

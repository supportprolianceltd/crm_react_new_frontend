## 🚀 Auto-Assignment to Clusters

### Overview
The rostering service provides intelligent auto-assignment endpoints for both clients and carers to clusters. These endpoints use a multi-step assignment algorithm that prioritizes location-based clustering for optimal care visit scheduling.

---

## 1. Client Auto-Assignment

### Endpoint: `POST /api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-client`

### Algorithm Logic

The endpoint follows this hierarchical assignment logic:

1. **Postcode Direct Match**: Check if any existing cluster has the exact same postcode
2. **Related Postcode Match**: Check if any existing clients/carers with the same postcode are assigned to clusters
3. **Distance-Based Match**: Use Google Maps API to calculate driving distance to existing clusters (≤1km threshold)
4. **New Cluster Creation**: Create a new cluster if no suitable existing cluster is found

### Endpoint Details

**Method**: `POST`  
**URL**: `http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-client`  
**Headers**:
```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Central London",
    "postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
    "latitude": 51.5074,
    "longitude": -0.1278
  }'

# Create test cluster in North London
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "North London",
    "postcode": "N1 9AL",
    "latitude": 51.5308,
    "longitude": -0.0973
  }'
```

### Run Auto-Assignment Tests

# Test distance match
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-client \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Nearby Client","postcode":"SW1A 2AA","address":"Nearby Address"}'

# Test new cluster creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-client \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Remote Client","postcode":"E1 6AA","address":"Remote Address"}'
```

### Verify Results
Check cluster assignments:
```bash
# List all clusters with client counts
curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Check specific cluster details
curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/{clusterId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Google Maps API Errors
**Symptom**: Distance calculations fail
**Solution**:
1. Verify `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
2. Check API key has Distance Matrix API enabled
3. Ensure API key has sufficient quota

#### No Cluster Assignment
**Symptom**: Client not assigned to any cluster
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check if postcode normalization is working
2. Verify existing clusters have location data
3. Check Google Maps API responses in logs

#### Database Connection Issues
**Symptom**: 500 errors on database operations
**Solution**:
1. Verify PostgreSQL container is running
2. Check database connection string
3. Ensure PostGIS extensions are enabled

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging to see detailed operation flow:
```bash
# Set log level to debug in environment
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor Google Maps API usage:
```bash
# Check cache statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/travel-matrix/cache/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

## 2. Carer Auto-Assignment

### Endpoint: `POST /api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-carer`

### Overview
The carer auto-assignment endpoint automatically assigns existing carers to appropriate clusters using the same intelligent matching logic as client assignment. This ensures carers are grouped with clients in their geographic area for efficient visit scheduling.

### Algorithm Logic
The endpoint follows the same hierarchical assignment logic as client assignment:

1. **Postcode Direct Match**: Check if any existing cluster has the exact same postcode
2. **Related Postcode Match**: Check if any existing clients/carers with the same postcode are assigned to clusters
3. **Distance-Based Match**: Use Google Maps API to calculate driving distance to existing clusters (≤1km threshold)
4. **New Cluster Creation**: Create a new cluster if no suitable existing cluster is found

### Request Body

```json
{
  "carerId": "carer_123",
  "postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
  "address": "123 Buckingham Palace Road, London",
  "town": "London",
  "city": "London",
  "latitude": 51.5074,    // Optional
  "longitude": -0.1278    // Optional
}
```

### Required Fields
- `carerId`: ID of the carer (must exist in auth service)
- `postcode`: Carer's postcode (used for matching)
- `address`: Carer's full address (used for cluster naming and Google Maps geocoding)

### Optional Fields
- `town`, `city`: Additional location details
- `latitude`, `longitude`: GPS coordinates (if available, improves precision)

### Success Responses

#### 1. Assigned to Existing Cluster (Postcode Match)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "assigned_to_existing_cluster",
  "clusterId": "cluster_123",
  "clusterName": "Central London Hub",
  "carerId": "carer_456",
  "reason": "postcode_match",
  "message": "Carer assigned to cluster \"Central London Hub\" due to matching postcode"
}
```

#### 2. Assigned to Existing Cluster (Distance Match)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "assigned_to_existing_cluster",
  "clusterId": "cluster_789",
  "clusterName": "South Bank Area",
  "carerId": "carer_456",
  "reason": "distance_match",
  "distanceKm": "0.85",
  "durationMinutes": 12,
  "message": "Carer assigned to cluster \"South Bank Area\" due to proximity (0.85km, 12min drive)"
}
```

#### 3. New Cluster Created
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "new_cluster_created",
  "clusterId": "cluster_new_123",
  "clusterName": "123 Buckingham Palace Road, London",
  "carerId": "carer_456",
  "reason": "no_match_found",
  "message": "New cluster \"123 Buckingham Palace Road, London\" created and carer assigned"
}
```

### Testing Scenarios

#### Test Case 1: Postcode Direct Match
**Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-carer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "carerId": "carer_123",
    "postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
    "address": "10 Downing Street, London"
  }'
```

#### Test Case 2: Distance-Based Assignment
**Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-carer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "carerId": "carer_456",
    "postcode": "SW1A 2AA",
    "address": "Westminster Abbey, London"
  }'
```

#### Test Case 3: New Cluster Creation
**Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-carer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "carerId": "carer_789",
    "postcode": "E1 6AA",
    "address": "Brick Lane, London"
  }'
```

### Key Differences from Client Assignment
- **Carer Validation**: Validates carer exists in auth service before assignment
- **Database Records**: Creates `ClusterAssignment` records instead of `ClusterClient` records
- **No Carer Creation**: Carers must already exist; no auto-creation like clients
- **Assignment Logic**: Same postcode and distance matching logic

## Background Job Processing

### Overview
Both auto-assignment endpoints use **background job processing** with Redis-based queues to ensure:

- **Non-blocking API responses**: Immediate response with job ID for status tracking
- **Reliability**: Jobs continue processing even if the client disconnects or page refreshes
- **Scalability**: Multiple jobs can be processed concurrently
- **Fault tolerance**: Automatic retries for failed jobs (up to 3 attempts)

### Job Queue Architecture

```
API Request → Job Queued → Background Worker → Database Update
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Immediate     Job ID       Google Maps      Cluster
Response      Returned     API Calls        Assignment
```

### Job Status Tracking

    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "queueType": "carer",
    "filter": "completed",
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

### Job Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `waiting` | Job queued, waiting to be processed |
| `active` | Job currently being processed |
| `completed` | Job finished successfully |
| `failed` | Job failed after all retry attempts |
| `delayed` | Job delayed before processing |

### Testing Background Jobs

#### 1. Submit Auto-Assignment Job
```bash
# Submit client assignment job
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/auto-assign-client \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Smith",
    "postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
    "address": "123 Buckingham Palace Road, London"
  }'

# Response includes jobId
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "123",
  "status": "queued",
  "estimatedProcessingTime": "5-30 seconds"
}
```

#### 2. Check Job Status
```bash
# Check specific job status
curl -X GET http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/jobs/client/123/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Check all client jobs
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/jobs/client/status?status=completed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### 3. Monitor Job Progress
```bash
# Poll job status until completion
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/rostering/clusters/jobs/client/123/status \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" | jq -r '.data.status')
  echo "Job status: $STATUS"
  if [ "$STATUS" = "completed" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "failed" ]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 2
done
```

### Background Worker Management

The auto-assign worker runs continuously in the background and:

- **Processes jobs automatically** as they are queued
- **Retries failed jobs** up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Logs all activity** for monitoring and debugging
- **Handles graceful shutdown** during server restarts

### Performance Benefits

- **Immediate API Response**: No waiting for Google Maps API calls
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple assignments can be processed simultaneously
- **Fault Tolerance**: Jobs survive server restarts and network issues
- **Resource Efficiency**: Heavy processing moved off main request threads
